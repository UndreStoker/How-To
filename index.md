Oncologists are doctors who diagnose and treat cancer. They often act as the main healthcare provider for someone with cancer—designing treatment plans, offering supportive care, and sometimes coordinating treatment with other specialists. 

What Does an Oncologist Do?

Oncology is the study of cancer. Oncologists specialize in managing and treating patients throughout the course of the disease, which involves:

Confirming a patient’s initial diagnosis
Explaining the cancer diagnosis and stage
Providing all possible treatment plans and offering recommendations
Overseeing the course of treatment
Helping patients manage symptoms and side effects of both the disease and the treatment plan
