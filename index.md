<h1 align="center"> How-to Shoot a Basketball </h1>

<p style='text-align: justify;'> I am a huge basketball fan and have been playing since the age of 6. The game of basketball is fairly simple in essence. The objective is to outscore your oponent and win the game. Pretty simple concept if you ask me. In order to score, you must place the ball into the hoop. Again, pretty simple right? There are a few ways you can get the ball into the hoop. The basic 3 are the jumpshot, the layup, and the dunk. Now there are several styles of each category but below will demonstrate the basic jumpshot. 
  
  Once you've mastered the basics you can begin to add your own personal twist to it and who's knows, you may become the next Steph Curry! And if you don't know who Steph Curry is you've probably been living under a rock for about the past 10 years but that's ok, I've included a link at the bottom of the page to help you get familiar </p>

<h1 align="center"> How-to Shoot a Basketball Step by Step Detailed Instructions </h1>

<h2 align="left"> Step 1: Having the Right Stance </h2>

<h3 align="left"> Part 1 </h3> Keep your feet no further than shoulder width apart, preferably closer together, and slightly staggered.[1] You should put your shooting foot very slightly ahead of your non-shooting foot. Your shooting foot is the foot on the same side as your shooting arm – if you’re right handed, it will be your right foot. Your feet should be turned 10 to 45 degrees towards your off hand side, and your shoulder, hip, and elbow should be aligned with the basket.

<h3 align="left"> Part 2 </h3> Flex your knees slightly. Locking your knees makes it easy for you to get knocked off balance. Flex your knees comfortably so you're in position to jump as soon as you have the ball.

<h2 align="left"> Step 2: Holding the Ball Correctly </h2>

<h3 align="left"> Part 1 </h3> Dip the ball down to your waist or thigh. The ball and your shooting eye should form a straight line to the basket.

<h3 align="left"> Part 2 </h3> Position your elbow so it's inline with your shoulder, not directly under the ball.

<h3 align="left"> Part 3 </h3> Grip the ball correctly. Position your shooting hand so that your fingertips are perpendicular to the seams in the ball.[3]  This hand is responsible for launching the ball. Place your non-shooting hand on the side of the ball to act as a guide for the shot. Your palm may or may not be touching the ball while you’re preparing to shoot - you may have control of the ball with your fingers and thumb.

<h2 align="left"> Step 3: Taking the Shot </h2>

<h3 align="left"> Part 1 </h3> Locate the target. If you want the ball to go into the net, then you need to look at the net. If you’re planning to bank the ball in off the backboard, then look at the spot on the backboard you want to hit. Your eyes are an incredibly important part of a good shot in basketball.

<h3 align="left"> Part 2 </h3> Straighten your knees and jump. Use your legs to help propel the ball by jumping upward while your shooting hand launches the ball and your shoulders lean back. Move your legs, torso, and arms together in a coordinated fashion to take the shot.

<h3 align="left"> Part 3 </h3> Jump slightly forward when you shoot, making sure your shoulders lean back and are relaxed. Your feet shouldn't land in the same position where they started because it will cause a lot of tension in your neck and shoulders. Jumping forward will also give your ball more arc.

<h3 align="left"> Part 4 </h3> Push the ball upward with your shooting hand. As your hips rise up and you start your jumping motion, move the ball in a smooth motion from your dip to eye level. It should all be one smooth motion. Your hips rise as your elbow rises with the ball, and you should turn anywhere from 20-90 degrees towards your off hand.

<h3 align="left"> Part 5 </h3> Release the ball. Just before you reach the height of your jump, release the ball, with your shooting hand aimed at the basket. Straighten your elbow and push your wrist so that the ball arches, rather than moving toward the basket in a straight line. As you release the ball, your guiding hand should move to lightly touch your shooting arm just below the wrist.
